# Squid Server Platform

Squid's Server Platform is the revolutionary and performant code base for Minecraft: Java Edition Servers.

Squid is made by Developers, for Developers. With a large modifiable codebase, minimal Vanilla Server Code, and plenty of addons, Squid is not meant for the light hearted

### But why?

Because I am tired of the non performant and incredibly laggy server software of today's era. With the rampant RAM usage, useless Java GC, and high CPU usage, I want server development to be more accessible.

### Okay, how do I help?

If you know C# or Java, you are of use. Fork (and star) this repository, add/fix code, create a pull request, and that is how you may help.

### Developer Things

Squid is targeted for .NET Framekwork 7, but will most likely compile on any version after 7. 

Keep outside packages to a minimal, if any at all.

I'm a highschooler, it may take time to see pull requests.
